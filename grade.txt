Your app was mostly functional, which was great.

The biggest criticisms we had were the lack of completeness of the back end, specifically adding restaurants. There were also some issues with the UI - when editing or updating values you
had to refresh the UI to see the changes, which was unfortunate.

I was surprised that you spent so much time on credit card processing. From my perspective I would've much rather seen you skip this part in favor of making sure that the
rest of the app was working flawlessly. The features that you showed off were mostly part of the library from my understanding, and this presentation should have been a showcase
of the work that your group did, not the library.

Overall though, the majority of the functionality worked. Great job on the project.
